Feature: Access and manipulate the events feature

  As a user of actionmap
  So that I can become more involved in events happening in my community
  I want to be able to create and access events through actionmap

Background:
  When I am on the login page
  Then I should see "Select an authentication provider below to login."
  Then I should see "Sign in with Google"
  And I should see "Sign in with GitHub"
  And I press "Sign in with Google"
  When I am on the login page
  Then I should see "Your Profile"

Scenario: Access events pages
  When I am on the home page
  And I follow "Events"
  Then I should see "Pride Parade"
  And I should see "Climate Strike"
  When I follow "view-Pride Parade"
  Then I should see "Alameda County, CA"

#NOTE: Because selecting a county requires that the state be selected,
# it seemed impossible to me to get it to pick a county. Every time
# you tell it to pick a county, the list of counties is empty,
# so it fails.

Scenario: Add event error case
  When I am on the events page

  And I fill in "event_description" with "you can't know"
  And I select "Nevada" from "actionmap-event-state"
